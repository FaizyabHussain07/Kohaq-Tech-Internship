    <b>Why I want to become a front-end developer?</b>
<p>I want to become a front-end developer because I love the idea of building things that people can see and use.
        It feels amazing to write code and watch it turn into a real, working website. I enjoy being creative and also
        solving problems, and front-end development lets me do both. I want to create websites that are easy to use and
        look good, making the internet a better place for everyone. It's an exciting field that is always changing, and
        I am eager to learn and grow with it.</p>
